# Learning Python Repo 

This is a simple repo for me to learn Python and Git. 
Keep in mind this is a publicly documented learning journey, the code here is likely to be 'bad' (sometimes very bad), but with each push it should get less bad, and maybe one day it'll even be good. ❤️

## Resources I'm using to learn Python: 
* [Automate The Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com)
	* This has been an invaluable introductory resource for me. The chapters are a perfect balance of theory and practical applications for Python. I highly reccomend it!
* [Codecademy](www.codecademy.com)
	* Whilst I'm not currently using Codecademy, in the past it taught me my first ifs and elses, so it deserves a spot on the list.
